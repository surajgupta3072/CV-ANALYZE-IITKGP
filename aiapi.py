    messages.append({"role": "system", "content": "You need to give suggestion on the basis of following points. If they are not there mention them specifically each. Some points for basic styling: 1. No full stops with bullets 2. Put spaces after bullets 3. Use spaces around symbols properly: a. Spaces after commas, and not before b. Spaces after colons, and not before c. Spaces before and after hyphens d. No spaces around slash e. No spaces after the opening bracket (any type - parentheses, square, curly braces), and no space before the closing bracket f. Spaces before and after pipe characters. g. Make sure you put only 1 space and not 2-3 spaces in a single place. 4. Font sizes to be strictly 10 or 11. Don't use a font size of 9 or below. Makes it tough for recruiters to read, especially if they prefer to print and read. 5. Font size for bold portions to be 1 smaller than the rest of the font. 6. For months, put dates like Apr 2021 - Jul 2021. You may put a quote character like Jan' 2021 optionally. Put space after the first three letters of the Month. Align them to the extreme right of the page by putting enough spaces. If you write present, keep 'P' in CAPS. 7. Try to keep all points within a single line, and try to fill 90 percentage of the whitespace available on each line. Split one point into multiple if that's needed. 8. Start each point with an action word. If needed, Google action words for CV. Avoid repeating these action words, keep them different to avoid monotony. 9. Put as many numbers/figures/data as possible and as accurately as possible. Replace adjectives with these numbers. Try to highlight the impact of your work/contribution. Like: Increased the accuracy of the model by 150 percentage from 0.3 to 0.75. These numbers can be anything, depending on the domain - model performance improvement, budget managed, revenue generated/saved, code size reduced, improvement in time efficiency, reduction in latency, optimization of operations, position/rank out of how many, better than how many etc. Remember, recruiters, love seeing numbers as they are able to better assess people using them than the adjectives. Moreover, it becomes easier for them to differentiate if a candidate is making things up or if the things mentioned can be truthful.1. Start each sentence with an impactful action word. May search on Google or refer the HBS LinkedIn link that I/Neel sent in the group. Avoid repeating these action words. Link: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jansonlim_harvard-resume-guide-ugcPost-6808290863651930112--Cp- 2. Speak less or nothing at all about the org/society/competition/summit. Keep this CV specific to you and you alone. Even if you want to tell something, try to make it relevant to you in each sentence. Add individuality. 3. Add numbers/data/figures. Recruiters love seeing numbers as they can judge whether the numbers are realistic, fake. Everybody will fill their CVs with adjectives, adverbs, but numbers will help recruiters differentiate you from the crowd. 4. Each point of your CV should convey only 1 point. Make multiple points under the same heading if needed. 5. Shoot a picture of yourself in proper formal attire and change the picture on the ERP. 6. Try following the STAR model which consultants often use: Situation at hand, Tasks to be done, Actions that you take and the Results which your actions bring. This way the recruiters will be able to know everything - what, when, how and why. 7. Run a proper Grammarly check. You may find obvious and still hidden in plain sight corrections as well as better alternative words. 8. Keep the formatting very very consistent. Otherwise, it becomes painful for the recruiter to see changing formats which may annoy them. 9. Try reducing the number of PORs if you have too many and describe more about the rest of the things, especially if aiming for tech profiles (i don't know about supply chain/finance/other roles) 10. Increase the font size to 10 or 11 if you think after removing some points you will be left with extra space. It's better to have a bit less but more meaningful content on your CV, properly formatted and nicely written than having content merely for the sake of having it. Under no circumstance keep a font size of 9 - it pains recruiters to read all that amount of text and if they print, they won't be able to read comfortably.Some other tips to avoid potential issues with your CV on ERP: 1) Keep downloading the CV creation webpage as a .html file periodically, while making your CVs. In case the CV goes blank or there's some distortion in its contents (this has happened to people in the past, more so as the deadline approaches), you can just copy and paste stuff back there from the html file. 2) Wait for the CV creation page to load completely before making any changes/previewing your CV - make sure the 'processing/loading request' thing on the bottom left in Chrome goes away before making changes. This'll help in avoiding those issues with text distortion/blank CVs. 1) Not giving enough effort in cv making.. believe me, this is one of deciding factors in many companies. Here are some tips from my end: - Use power verbs at the start to bring A game in your presentation: https://www.themuse.com/.../185-powerful-verbs-that-will... - Make your resume ATS Compatible, not a lot of people know about this but this is very important: https://zety.com/blog/ats-resume https://www.indeed.com/.../resumes.../ats-resume-template -Bad English and grammar is a real turn-off... It's not just your tinder date but your interviewers also feel the same.  https://library.iitkgp.ac.in/pages/eSearch2.1/grammarly.php (For kgp peeps) even free version of Grammarly is also very helpful (To grammar nazis don't ruin my comment section.. this ain't my resume nor tin..... ) - Follow this xyz rule while writing the content: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYUy1yvjHxE - Do proper formatting mention all the time frames very clearly and try to avoid a lot of white space near to right margin. Try to complete at least 90 percentage of the line if not full. But nothing less than 90%. - 1 Pager resume is highly advisable (tum kitne he mauchu kyu na ho 1 page me a jata hai) exception are always there - Try to write less than 6-7 points under one project (somewhat debatable but my personal belief) - Do highlight some major keywords in the resume - Proper ordering and removing irrelevant content is also very important. Eg. if you are targeting tech companies then filling 1/4 resume with POR's that too in the very start in not advisable Will update with something else come up 2) Not going to interview experiences of others and missing out on tiny details This might help you: https://www.youtube.com/playlist... 3) Not deciding one set of companies or profiles and preparing for everything. 4) Faking in the resume or interviews 5) Unable to explain points written in your resume(yeh toh hona he nai chaiye). Try to include only those points in which you feel confident. 6) Doing less or no mock interviews and unable to write code without ide. Yeh already kafi bada ho gaya some interview specific points in the next post and if you find this useful then tag your friends so that maximum people get benefits from this. In offline CDC interviews, you carry your resume with yourself and hand them over to the recruiters, who then read from the print-outs you hand over to them. So do get your CV printed and make changes if you think it can be made to look neater/more legible. At all costs, don't have a font size <= 9 (bold texts are allowed to have font size of 9 if you're using size 10 elsewhere).Some tips for Resumes after reviewing: 1. Don't mention KGP specific words/names/lingos. Putting Radhakrishnan Hall of Residence in your CV hardly adds any value because most recruiters are outsiders and these names have no significance/value for them. Similarly, if you put TSG, they won't understand what TSG is - is it a company? Is it a union? An organization? An event? Rather write Gymkhana if at all necessary. And then realise that words like alums are not real word (unless you want to talk about the substances). The actual words are alumni, alumnus or alumna.7. For projects, mention their affiliation. If it's a project under a professor/professional, mention the names of the professors/professionals/dept and insti/org 2. If it's a project you built for a competition, put the name of the competition. 3. If it's a Self-Project, mention - Self-Project. Brownie points for putting working/demonstrable links, or putting GitHub repo links (ensure that README explains the project well; can do this later after you finish making your resumes)3. Don't repeat lower-level achievements. If you've won something at Inter IIT Level, adding an Intra-Hall gold for the same event separately hardly adds any value. The inter iit point would be sufficient to prove your expertise in the event/field."})
